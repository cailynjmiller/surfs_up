# Overview
W. Avy was inspired on his trip to Hawaii to open a surf and ice cream shop. To see if this would be a worthwhile investment, W.Avy wanted to perform an anlysis on monthly temperatures in Hawaii in June and December to see if there was desireble weather year-round since the business model hinges on ideal weather

# Results
- The standard deviation was higher for temperatures in December than June and the minimum temperature is about 9 degrees less. This means that there is slightly more variation in temperatures in the winter time than the summer time so W.Avy will have to be aware of some fluctuations which may make people desire surfing and ice-cream less.

- The temperatures stay relatively consistent between June and December. The Mean, 25% quartile, 50% quartile (median), and 75% quartile are all only about 3 degrees off. This means that W.Avy can expect consistent weather year round and shouldn't expect too many fluctuations in sales throughout the year based on weather alone.

- The min and max temperatures for December and June are not too far off from the average. For June, the min is about 10 degrees cooler and teh max about 10 degrees hotter. For December, the min is about 15 degrees cooler and 12 degrees higher. This is further proof that Hawaii doesn't have extreme weather fluctuations and should be a safe spot for a surf and ice cream shop.
